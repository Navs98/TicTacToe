# TicTacToe Game

This is a simple implementation of the TicTacToe game in Java.

## Description

The TicTacToe game is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- Allows two players to play against each other.
- Displays the current state of the board after each move.
- Validates user inputs and prevents invalid moves.
- Determines the winner or declares a draw when the game is over.

## How to Play

2. Enter the names of the two players.
3. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row (a, b, c) and column (1, 2, 3) of the grid, e.g., "a1" or "b2".
4. The game continues until one player wins or the board is full.
